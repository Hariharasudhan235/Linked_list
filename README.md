Project Overview (README.md):

Provide a detailed description of what a linked list is, its advantages and disadvantages compared to other data structures (like arrays), and the specific features of your implementation. Include examples of how to use the linked list, along with input and output samples.
Installation Instructions:

Offer step-by-step instructions for setting up the project locally. Specify any prerequisites (programming languages, compilers, or libraries) and include commands for running the code. This can be part of the README or a separate INSTALL.md file.
Functionality Breakdown:

Create a section that outlines the key operations supported by your linked list implementation, such as:
Insertion (at the head, tail, or specific position)
Deletion (by value or position)
Searching for elements
Traversing the list
Provide code snippets or examples for each operation.
Code Documentation:

Ensure your code is well-commented, explaining the logic behind key functions and classes. Consider adding a docs/ folder that provides more detailed documentation on the linked list's structure, methods, and usage patterns.
Contributing Guidelines:

Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file to invite collaboration. Outline how others can contribute to the project, including coding standards, reporting issues, and the process for submitting pull requests. This encourages a collaborative approach to development.
